## About Me  
I’m a hands-on developer who loves building real-world systems using Java, Spring Boot, and React.  
From APIs to Dockerized deployments, I focus on writing clean code and pushing it live—fast and efficiently.

## What You'll Find  
🚀 Projects across fullstack web apps, backend systems, and cloud deployment pipelines  
🛠️ Skills in JavaScript, Spring Boot, React.js, Node.js, REST APIs, Docker, GitHub Actions, and AWS basics  
💡 I bring fast problem-solving, clean architecture, and end-to-end delivery to every project

## My Mission  
To master backend-first development and DevOps practices that scale.  
I’m here to ship production-ready code, automate the boring stuff, and never stop leveling up.  
Collaboration, consistency, and code that speaks for itself—that’s the mindset.
